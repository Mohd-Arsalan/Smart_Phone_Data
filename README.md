Human Activity Recognition Using Smart Phones Data
In this project we have to predict the activity of a user whether a person is Laying, Standing , Sitting, Walking, Walking upstairs, or Walking downstairs.
Different algorithms have been implemented with different accuracy scores such as SVM, LR, KNN and Random Forest.
